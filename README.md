# Example

This code defines the github-hosted site
https://eidsnessje-nih.github.io/

Disclaimer: @eidsnessje-nih is a personal GitHub account and is not meant to represent NIH or the government, as such.
Access to personal user accounts is not controlled by the government, HHS or NIH, and staff must take care to avoid
misrepresenting their activity.


Any NIH/HHS/government activity on GitHub would be hosted in an official org, for example, "@NHGRI". A government managed GitHub
organization is necessarily going to have personal GitHub accounts listed as members. Material hosted in the official
organization will occasionally refer to these personal account names, but it is important to recognize that access
to the organization has been and will continue to be secured and governed by additional authentication & authorization
systems that HHS and the federal government do, in fact, control.
